## üß† Core Systems

### 1. Gallery, Profiles, and Admin Dashboard

- **User Profiles:**  
  Each registered user has a profile displaying their name, avatar, and recent activity.  
  Profile images are stored in **AWS S3** and automatically cleaned up when updated.

- **Admin Dashboard:**  
  The admin doesn‚Äôt have a profile. Instead, they manage the platform through a dashboard that includes:
  - Uploading and editing posts
  - Tracking inventory totals and values
  - Applying discounts or posting sale messages on the homepage
  - Creating and managing auctions
  - Sending and receiving messages with users

- Responsive gallery with dynamic post display.
- Secure S3 image upload and cleanup logic.

### 2. Messaging

- Real-time encrypted chat between admin and users.
- Typing indicators
- See [WebSocket Messaging Implementation](./docs/WEBSOCKET_IMPLEMENTATION.md).

### 3. Auctions

- Time-based and Buy-It-Now auctions.
- Automated expiration via `node-cron`.
- Real-time bid updates and notifications.
- See [Auctions & Notifications System](./docs/AUCTIONS_AND_NOTIFICATIONS.md).

### 4. Notifications

- Outbid, win, and auction-ended alerts.
- Live badge counters via WebSockets and Zustand store.
